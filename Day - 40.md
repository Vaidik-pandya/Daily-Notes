Daily Notes : Day 40 
Source code and already disclosed reports can be a big resource for #bugbounty hunters it’s not about just looking in them it can give you multiple resources 

Scenarios:
Suppose someone found an information disclosures on http://redacted.com/db.txt now here in the report you can acces the data in text file and its patched but you can look for the wayback or archive org for it’s screenshots it might still leak details so be aware of it just a rare/theory scenario but worth checking it 

And for source code always have a look on third part or domains in it. Doing this can give you good results
