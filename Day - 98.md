Apk pentesting - Part 7

SQLite DBs;
Most of the applications will use internal SQLite databases to save information. During the pentest take a look to the databases created, the names of tables and columns and all the data saved because you could find sensitive information (which would be a vulnerability).
Databases should be located in /data/data/the.package.name/databases like /data/data/com.mwr.example.sieve/databases
If the database is saving confidential information and is encrypted but you can find the password inside the application it's still a vulnerability.
Enumerate the tables using .tables and enumerate the columns of the tables doing .schema <table_name>
